Deployment Quick Guide
======================

This page is intended for systems administrators who are experienced with 
installing web server applications and want to get LImBuS up and running 
quickly.

Basic Requirements
------------------

- A machine running Debian 10. Something about Ubuntu likely working, but only been tested on Debian. Link to issues.

Setting up Docker
-----------------

Removing old versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, it's always a good idea to remove any old versions you may have installed:
::

 sudo apt docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
 
There's no need to worry if :code:`apt` states that none of the above packages are installed as this is just a precautionary step.

Setting up the official Docker repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, run a quick :code:`apt update` to ensure that Debian's repositories are updated:
::

  sudo apt update
  
Once that has completed, install the following packages - as so we can use a repository securely over HTTPS:
::

 sudo apt install \
   apt-transport-https \
   ca-certificates \
   curl \
   gnupg-agent \
   software-properties-common
   
Depending on your internet connection, this may take a couple seconds to complete. Once it has, add the GPG of the Docker project:
::

 curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Getting LImBuS
--------------

There are two basic options:


Download
~~~~~~~~

Version Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pull the code from the git repository:
::

 git clone https://www.github.com/AbersystwythSystemsBiology/limbus
 
This will...

::

  git checkout <version>
  



This command will fetch a complete copy of the LImBuS repository.
