Bug Reports

Part of being free and open is our willingness to participate in public bug 
tracking. We make use of GitHub to help orchestrate our development... 
something about signing up.

We understand that many of our users are going to be new to working
with this, and it can be difficult to submit your first bug. So here's a simple
step-by-step guide you can follow to get you started:

1. Visit the "Issues" page on our GitHub: 

2. Search the issue list to ensure that your report hasn't been filed already. If
your report has already been filed by someone else, comment that you are 
experiencing the same problem - so we know that you're also affected.

3. If you believe your bug is a new one, then feel free to create a "New 
Issue". Type in a complete (more on this shortly) summary and description
of your issue and submit it.


What makes a good report?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a couple of pointers:

* **Specific Summary:** Think of the summary as the title of the issue you're 
reporting. It's important to be specific because it makes our lives easier 
when searching. Submitting a summary like "it doesn't work" doesn't really 
help us achieve that. Instead consider something like "Unable to submit 
transfer request" or "Error when viewing User Profile".

* **Provide Information:** Provide as much information you can including, 
where appropriate the exception that has been thrown.

* **Help us Help you:** We may ask you to provide more information. Failure to
assist will likely lead to us closing the issue, even if the problem hasn't 
been fixed.
