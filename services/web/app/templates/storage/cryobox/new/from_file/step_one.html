                As this is in the early stages of development, there is a tight restriction on what is deemed a valid
                cryovial container file. Firslty, you must ensure that the file is in the comma-seperated file format exported 
                to the following standard: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Unicode (UTF-8) character set.</li>
                <li>',' as the field delimiter.</li>
                <li>And '"' as the string delimiter.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In order for the file to be read, the CSV file must have the following column headings on the first row:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>"Tube Barcode:"" The reference string of characters used to interrogate LImBuS for existing samples.</li>
                <li>Tube Position: The position of the vial in the form of A1, B2, F42.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>
                If the file contains additional attribute information, it will be <b>disregarded entirely</b>.
            </p>

                        formats that comply with open standards.
